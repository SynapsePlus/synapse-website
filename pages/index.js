              SYNAPSE+ came to birth amidst the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic in 2021 with the focus of alleviating the economical and healthcare burdens that the historical global event has inevitably caused. Our company has won the 1st runner up in the COVID-19 Hackathon 2021 hosted by Imperial College and have also since qualified as the L’Oreal’s Global Brandstorm National Finalist.

            <div className="text-center w-8/12 mx-auto leading-6 pb-4">
              As the Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology defines, ‘synapse’ is the junction between a nerve fibre of one neuron and another neuron; the site of interneuronal communication. Our name was inspired by our vision to becoming the connecting line between the differentiated silos within our healthcare system, a place where the different parts of our healthcare ecosystem could find the balance to interact and communicate with each other.
